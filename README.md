# UTG-Student Dashboard

A flexible and elegant student management system of the University of The Gambia.
_Dashboard is built by the students for the students._

Dashboard uses the Portal system of UTG as a center of verification for users. The same portal is therefore
used as the main source of users-data for analysis and presentation among others. This makes it impossible for
non-UTG students to use the system. Such students can however bypass this mechanism and get to temporarily use
Dashboard by providing details by hand. See main.GeneralTester class for information on how to do this.

This project does not use any frameworks - only and only the core java in conjunction with several
'3rd-party libraries'. Please see the overview.txt file for more information.

##### "A journey of thousand miles begins with a single step"
Dashboard is an ambitious project aimed at relating to the students fundamentals of desktop development.
Thus, allowing independent developers to easily integrate whatever they're building for the students of
the UTG.

For ease of access and use, and platform-independence reasons, Dashboard is distributed as a JAR file.
